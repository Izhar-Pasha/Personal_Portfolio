        <p>
          I'm passionate about building user-centric applications that solve
          real-world problems. With expertise in both frontend and backend
          development, I bring ideas to life through clean code and innovative
          solutions. Always eager to learn, grow, and collaborate on exciting
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the tech bubble, life takes on a different rhythm. I love
          soaking up family time, finding peace in the mosque, getting lost in
          the world of poetry, and, of course, unwinding with a good dose of
          online content.
